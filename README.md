React stata is used to update functions,We use callback function in state if our new value depends on the old value(
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
    function functionName(
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount +/- 1)
    )
)

                    Tenary Operator
const isGoingOut = true;
const answer = isGoingOut ? true : false
const answer = isGoingOut === "true" ? "Yes" : "No"
console.log(answer).
I read something this morning that tenary operation is not conditional operator instead a tenary operator is a conditional operator
